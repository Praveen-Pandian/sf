                <p class="content">Listening doesn’t help just you stay on track but also can give you a cue of how you can contribute to the topic.

                <h1 class="heading">Relevancy</h1>
                <p class="content">Sticking to the main subject is utmost important to make the others know your content is relevant and it shows that you are keenly observing. Any case studies, articles or examples could be additional support to a content deficient topic therefore passing an evidence is a critical advantage here.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Confidence!!</h1>
                <p class="content">Everyone’s different but in a GD it all comes down to being confident enough to present one’s opinion. Expressing your opinion is what matters in a GD, it could be disagreed by the others or let down but with a confident tone and planned countermeasure, nothing will stop you!!</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Perspective attack!</h1>
                <p class="content">Just presenting from one point of view is always a blunt blow to the opponent so why not try a different view? Asking questions that is whole lot different from the current stream and challenging with another viewpoint definitely affects the opponent’ confidence to give an immediate reply.</p>
